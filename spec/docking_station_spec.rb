# be_XXX where XXX is name of method, responds to method call. eg. be_crying responds to crying? (true or false)
#Â the test will pass if the method returns true

# subject in line 11 is basically self. So we call method release_bike on class DockingStation.
# this method - when called - returns new instance of class Bike.
# we call it bike :P
